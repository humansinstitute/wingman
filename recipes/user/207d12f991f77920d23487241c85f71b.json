Initial Project Discovery\n```\nUsing files_readonly MCP:\n- Navigate to ~/code/<Project Directory>\n- Identify current .worktree/branch\n- Map project structure and technology stack\n- Locate configuration files, entry points, and key components\n- Examine dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.)\n```\n\n```\nUsing mcpobsidian MCP:\n- Search for project-specific documentation\n- Review architectural decision records (ADRs)\n- Identify security requirements and threat models\n- Locate previous security assessments\n- Understand business context and risk tolerance\n```\n\n### 2. Comprehensive Code Analysis\nFocus on these critical security areas while leveraging both MCP tools:\n\n#### Authentication & Authorization\n- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities\n- Weak password policies or storage mechanisms\n- Session management implementation flaws\n- Privilege escalation attack vectors\n- Missing or insufficient authorization checks\n- Cross-reference with documented security policies\n\n#### Input Validation & Injection Prevention\n- SQL injection vulnerabilities across data layers\n- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in web interfaces\n- Command injection in system interactions\n- Path traversal in file operations\n- XML/JSON injection in API endpoints\n- LDAP injection in directory services\n- Validate against documented input validation standards\n\n#### Data Protection & Privacy\n- Sensitive data exposure in logs, errors, or responses\n- Inadequate encryption implementation\n- Insecure data storage practices\n- PII handling compliance issues\n- Data leakage through debugging information\n- Cross-reference with privacy documentation\n\n#### Business Logic Security\n- Race condition vulnerabilities\n- Time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) issues\n- Workflow bypass vulnerabilities\n- Insufficient rate limiting mechanisms\n- Logic flaws enabling unauthorized access\n- Validate against documented business rules\n\n#### Infrastructure & Configuration Security\n- Insecure network configurations\n- Missing security headers\n- Inadequate logging and monitoring\n- Container and deployment security issues\n- Cloud service misconfigurations\n- Environment-specific security settings\n\n### 3. Documentation-Code Alignment Review\n- Compare implemented security controls with documented requirements\n- Identify gaps between intended and actual security measures\n- Validate that security architecture matches implementation\n- Check for undocumented security-sensitive code paths\n\n### 4. Technology-Specific Security Checks\n\n#### Web Applications\n- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment\n- CSRF protection implementation\n- Security headers configuration (CSP, HSTS, HPKP, etc.)\n- Cookie security attributes and SameSite policies\n- URL redirection and open redirect vulnerabilities\n\n#### API Security\n- Authentication and authorization mechanisms\n- Rate limiting and request throttling\n- Input validation and output encoding\n- API versioning security considerations\n- GraphQL-specific security issues (if applicable)\n- API documentation exposure risks\n\n#### Mobile Applications (if applicable)\n- Local data storage security\n- Inter-app communication security\n- Certificate pinning implementation\n- Code obfuscation and anti-tampering\n- Platform-specific
