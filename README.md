# Wingman: Goose 

He can be your wingman... anytime.

**A multi-session development platform for Goose AI agents with persistence, recipe management, and remote access.**

No longer do you have to sit at your desk typing on your keyboard like a caveman.

Wingman transforms Goose into a powerful, persistent development environment that you can access from anywhere. Use those wings my little gosling, fly free and explore.

Wingman provides a server architecture with session management, structured data persistence, and a recipe ecosystem to your installed Goose Cli. Marry it to Tailscale and you can leave Goose at home with your computer while you check in on your agents, setup new tasks, run workflows, or push along chats from your laptop, phone, or wherever you are.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **goose-cli-wrapper.js** - Spawns and controls Goose CLI processes
- **shared-state.js** - Manages conversation state and Goose integration
- **cli.js** - Command-line interface with Goose controls
- **server.js** - Express + Socket.IO web server with Goose API
- **index.js** - Main launcher for both interfaces
- **public/index.html** - Web interface with Goose controls

### How It Works

1. **Goose Integration**: Spawns Goose CLI as child process
2. **Message Parsing**: Captures and parses Goose output
3. **State Management**: Shared conversation state across interfaces
4. **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket-based synchronization
5. **Session Control**: Full Goose session lifecycle management

## Goose CLI Commands Supported

The application supports all standard Goose CLI features:

- **Session Management**: Start, stop, resume sessions
- **Extensions**: Add stdio, remote, and built-in extensions
- **Mode Control**: Switch between auto, approve, chat modes
- **Planning**: Create structured plans with `/plan`
- **Tool Integration**: Full access to Goose's tool ecosystem

## Example Workflow

1. Start the application: `npm start`
2. Open web interface: http://localhost:3000
3. Start a Goose session: `/goose-start my-project`
4. Send messages from either CLI or web interface
5. Use Goose commands: `/goose-cmd /plan implement user authentication`
6. Watch real-time synchronization between interfaces

## Troubleshooting

### Goose Not Found
Ensure Goose CLI is installed and available in your PATH:
```bash
goose --version
```

### Session Not Starting
Check if Goose is properly configured:
```bash
goose configure
```

### Port Already in Use
Change the port in server.js or kill existing processes:
```bash
pkill -f "node.*goose-intCLI"
```

## Development

The application is designed to be extensible and can be enhanced with:
- Custom Goose extension integration
- Additional UI components
- Enhanced message parsing
- Session templates and automation
- Integration with other AI tools
