## Architecture Overview

### Before (Fragmented)
```
worktree-main/
├── recipes/          # Isolated recipes
├── data/wingman.db   # Isolated sessions
└── metadata.json     # Fragmented usage data

worktree-feature/
├── recipes/          # Different recipes
├── data/wingman.db   # Different sessions  
└── metadata.json     # Different usage data
```

### After (Centralized)
```
~/.wingman/
├── recipes/          # Shared across all worktrees
│   ├── built-in/
│   ├── user/
│   └── imported/
├── data/
│   └── wingman.db    # Shared database with worktree tracking
├── backup/           # Migration backups
└── config.json       # System configuration

Multiple worktrees → All reference centralized storage
```

## Migration Process

1. **Discovery**: Automatically finds all Wingman installations
2. **Analysis**: Identifies conflicts and duplication
3. **Planning**: Creates detailed migration plan
4. **Backup**: Comprehensive backup before changes
5. **Migration**: Consolidates recipes and sessions
6. **Verification**: Validates successful migration
7. **Cleanup**: Optional cleanup of legacy files

## Key Benefits Achieved

### For Users
- ✅ Recipes available in all worktrees
- ✅ Sessions resume across any worktree  
- ✅ Unified usage statistics
- ✅ No learning curve - seamless transition
- ✅ Better development workflow

### For System
- ✅ Eliminated data fragmentation
- ✅ Improved performance with centralized access
- ✅ Enhanced data consistency
- ✅ Better analytics and insights
- ✅ Simplified backup and maintenance

## Rollback Strategy

The system includes comprehensive rollback capabilities:

1. **Backup Preservation**: All original data backed up for 30+ days
2. **Version Detection**: Automatic legacy/centralized mode detection
3. **Compatibility Mode**: Fallback to legacy paths if needed
4. **Manual Rollback**: Restoration scripts available if needed

## Future Enhancements

The architecture supports future enhancements:

1. **Recipe Marketplace**: Integration with shared recipe repositories
2. **Team Sharing**: Multi-user recipe collaboration
3. **Cloud Sync**: Recipe synchronization across machines
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed usage patterns and optimization
5. **Recipe Versioning**: Version control for recipe evolution

## Conclusion

The Recipe Management System Productionisation has been successfully implemented, addressing all critical issues identified in the PRD:

- ❌ Recipe fragmentation → ✅ Centralized storage
- ❌ Metadata divergence → ✅ Unified analytics  
- ❌ Database isolation → ✅ Shared database with worktree tracking
- ❌ Path dependencies → ✅ Robust path resolution
- ❌ Cross-worktree failures → ✅ Seamless worktree operations

The system is now production-ready and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining full backward compatibility.
